# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
It contains the R code and documentation files of "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

CodeBook.md tells us how the variables, the data, and any transformations or work was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code and can be run on Rstudio by importing the file.

TidySet.txt is the required second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
